### Scaling Messaging

- 📚 [REST API Best Practices](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/rest-api-best-practices)

### Twilio SendGrid 101: An Introduction to Sending Transactional Email

- 👀 [Twilio SendGrid 101 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/twilio_sendgrid_101)

Email is reliable, global, and offers flexibility that can't be met by other communications channels.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to implement the Twilio SendGrid Email API, and you can expect some deliverability tips to help you start sending at scale. What kind of scale? In 2022, SendGrid sent more than 1.6 trillion messages — 50 billion of which were sent during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday week alone while maintaining a 99 percent delivery rate.

You'll also see how the SendGrid dynamic templating system makes it possible to personalize your messages for each customer, allowing you to build lasting connections with your audience.

## Hands On Learning Resources

If you’ve used Twilio in the past, chances are you’ve only used one or two different products. One of the best ways to get exposed to new Twilio capabilities is to deploy and test out a sample application on the [Twilio CodeExchange](https://twilio.com/code-exchange). Choose a sample application from this repository, and get it running on your own Twilio account.

Here are some options for apps, tutorials, and video lessons to check out, broken down by product:
