### Twilio SendGrid 101: An Introduction to Sending Transactional Email

- 👀 [Twilio SendGrid 101 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/twilio_sendgrid_101)

In this workshop, you'll learn how to implement the Twilio SendGrid Mail Send API to programmatically deliver email at scale. You'll also see how the Twilio SendGrid dynamic templating system makes it possible to personalize your messages for each customer, and you can expect some deliverability pro-tips along the way.

## Hands On Learning Resources

If you’ve used Twilio in the past, chances are you’ve only used one or two different products. One of the best ways to get exposed to new Twilio capabilities is to deploy and test out a sample application on the [Twilio CodeExchange](https://twilio.com/code-exchange). Choose a sample application from this repository, and get it running on your own Twilio account.

Here are some options for apps, tutorials, and video lessons to check out, broken down by product:
