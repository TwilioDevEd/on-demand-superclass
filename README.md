### Twilio SendGrid 101: An Introduction to Sending Transactional Email

- 👀 [Twilio SendGrid 101 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/twilio_sendgrid_101)

Among the communication channels available today, email is non-negotiable. Email is reliable, works globally, and offers flexibility that can't be met by other communications avenues. In this workshop, you'll learn how to implement the Twilio SendGrid Mail Send API to programmatically deliver email at scale. You'll also see how the Twilio SendGrid dynamic templating system makes it possible to personalize your messages for each customer, and you can expect some deliverability pro-tips along the way.

### Scaling with Segment

- 👨‍🎓 [Segment University](https://university.segment.com)

You may ask yourself – what does a CDP have to do with developers? It’s pretty simple – you get to spend less time managing ETLs, and more time focusing on core products and customer experiences. Join us for a Superclass to explore how Segment can help support your engineering organization as it scales - ultimately lowering costs with first-party data your teams can trust.

## Hands On Learning Resources

If you’ve used Twilio in the past, chances are you’ve only used one or two different products. One of the best ways to get exposed to new Twilio capabilities is to deploy and test out a sample application on the [Twilio CodeExchange](https://twilio.com/code-exchange). Choose a sample application from this repository, and get it running on your own Twilio account.
